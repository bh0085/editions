Nami mono is created by 
<span class="name">ADAM O'DAY</span>
<span class="name">ANDREW JACOB</span>
<span class="name">AERONAUT</span>
<span class="name">JAPAS</span>
in celebration of great beer inspired by delicious art.
"Wave Things" in Japanese, we created this artwork
in consideration of the connectedness of our nations, 
the joys of international collaboration and the 
celebration of friendship.
</span>
<span>
Nami Mono is the first release in our series of
artwork-inspired beers, AERONAUT editions and is
available in a limited run of 50 limited-edition lithographs
on archival artistic paper by Funk &amp; Schuster in 
Provincetown Massachusetts.
